The two computers probably use different endian formats. To solve the problem, you should switch the endianness that your Intel processor uses, which is little-endian, to big-endian.

Coordinates from your processor: 
521,829 in little-endian hex = 65F60700
-2,207,359 in little-endian hex = -7FAE2100

Coordinates used for the NASA computer:
521,829 in big-endian hex = 0007F665
-2,207,359 in big-endian hex = -0021AE7F

You should use the second set of coordinates to search for the pictures you want.
